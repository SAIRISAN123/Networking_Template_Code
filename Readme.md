# Networking Template Code

This repository contains a collection of networking code templates for various protocols and use cases. It is designed to help developers quickly integrate networking functionalities into their projects using different programming languages. The repository includes examples for MQTT, TCP, UDP, and WebSockets, as well as platform-specific implementations like NodeMCU and Unity.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

- **`HiveMQ_mqtt_Python`**  
  MQTT communication using HiveMQ in Python, demonstrating how to publish and subscribe to topics.

- **`NodeMCU_MQTT_C++`**  
  MQTT communication implementation for NodeMCU (ESP8266/ESP32) using the PubSubClient library.

- **`TCP_Python`**  
  Python-based TCP client-server communication template.

- **`UDP_Python`**  
  Python-based UDP client-server communication template.

- **`Unity_Websocket_C#`**  
  WebSocket implementation for Unity, enabling real-time communication using `com.unity.transport`.

- **`WebSocket_Python`**  
  WebSocket client-server communication implemented in Python using the `websocket` library.

- **`mqtt_Broker`**  
  MQTT-based communication with a robot arm controller.

## üöÄ Features
